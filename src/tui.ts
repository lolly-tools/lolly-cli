/**
 * `lolly tui` - the interactive terminal shell, started from the one-shot one
 * (plans/202 WP1.4).
 *
 * One install, five doors: a person who has `lolly` should not have to learn that the
 * interactive surface is a second binary called `lolly-tui`. The verb is additive, which
 * plans/73 section 1.1 allows, and `tui` joins RESERVED_SUBCOMMANDS in args.ts so no
 * brand pack's tool id can ever shadow it.
 *
 * It runs the TUI in a CHILD process with stdio inherited, so the terminal, its size,
 * its signals and its exit code all pass straight through, and this process keeps the
 * one rule it exists to enforce (nothing here writes to stdout).
 *
 * Two entries, because the TUI ships two ways:
 *   • package - shells/tui compiled to dist/tui.js beside this bundle (scripts/pack-cli.ts).
 *   • repo    - shells/tui/bin/lolly-tui.tsx, run through tsx, since the source is .tsx
 *               and Node's type-stripping does not do JSX.
 * The compiled entry is tried first: where both exist, the built one is the shipped one.
