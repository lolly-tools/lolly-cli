/**
 * The CLI's output discipline (plans/73-cli-ga-contract.md §5.3 and §1.2).
 *
 * TWO rules, both frozen at GA:
 *
 *   1. stdout carries the PAYLOAD and nothing else — rendered bytes, the JSON
 *      envelope, or the human report for a report-shaped command. Every diagnostic
 *      goes to stderr, without exception. `note()`/`warn()` are how the rest of the
 *      shell says anything, so the rule is enforceable in one place.
 *   2. A write to stdout must be FLUSHED before the process exits. `process.exit()`
 *      after a large `write()` on a pipe discards the unflushed remainder — that is
 *      how `lolly … | wc -c` reported 65536 bytes for a 638897-byte PNG. `writeOut`
 *      awaits the write callback and NOTHING in this shell calls `exit()` after it.
 *
 * `--quiet` silences non-error stderr; `--strict` turns warnings into failures. Both
 * are process-wide settings rather than threaded parameters because every warning site
 * in this shell is a leaf (a stderr line beside real work) and threading a config
 * object through them all would be churn with no reader.

 * sandbox), so a hook that calls `console.log` directly writes to the real stdout —
 * which, on `lolly … --export=png > out.png`, lands INSIDE the PNG. No shipped tool
 * does it today; tools ship as data from another repository, so "no shipped tool does
 * it" is not a property this shell can rely on.
