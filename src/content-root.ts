 * "Where are the tools?" - the answer this CLI gives when it has no content.
 *
 * The published `@lolly-tools/cli` package carries NO tools and NO catalog (plans/131:
 * content-free binaries; community/ alone is 79 MB and a brand catalog another 56 MB).
 * It renders from a root someone points it at. In a checkout that root is found by the
 * marker walk in packages/node-shell/src/repo-root.ts and nobody ever thinks about it;
 * from `npm i -g` there is no marker anywhere above node_modules, and the first thing a
 * new user used to see was a raw ENOENT on catalog/tools/index.json.
 *
 * So a command that needs content checks first and exits 3 UNAVAILABLE_HERE - the
 * retry-somewhere-else code (see exit-codes.ts) - with the three real routes to a root.
 * Exit 2 would be wrong: the invocation was fine, this installation has nothing to run.
 *
 * The routes are the ones that exist today. There is no download here, and `lolly system
 * import` is listed for what it actually does (a design system: colours, fonts, logos -
 * see system.ts), NOT as a source of tools, because it is not one.

This CLI ships without content, so it renders from a root you point it at.
Three ways to get one:

  1. A directory holding tools/ and catalog/
       LOLLY_ROOT=/path/to/lolly lolly list
     A Lolly checkout has both after \`npm install\` builds the profile views.

  2. The desktop app
     Lolly for macOS, Windows and Linux carries its own tools and catalog, and
     from the next release it bundles this same CLI, so installing it is enough.

  3. lolly system import <pack.lolly>
     Your design system: colours, fonts and logos, kept on this machine and used
     by every render. It adds no tools, so it needs 1 or 2 beside it.

Looked in: ${named ? `LOLLY_ROOT, ` : ''}the directories above this install, and ${process.cwd()}.`;
