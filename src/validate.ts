 * `lolly validate <file> [--json] [--deep] [--trust-anchor=<root.pem>]` - 
 * on-device Content Credentials check for any stampable container (pdf,
 * png/apng, jpg, gif, svg, tiff, webp, mp4, webm).
 *
 * `--deep` additionally runs the web shell's neural pixel-watermark scan
 * (Adobe TrustMark / Meta Content Seal, incl. Lolly's own ?durable=1 mark)
 * by driving the built dist in the scoped Chromium - the same on-device
 * decode the /valid view runs. Needs the Tier-B setup (`lolly
 * install-browser` + `npm run build:web`); everything else in this file
 * stays DOM-free and browser-free.
 *
 * The same engine verifier that backs the web shell's /valid view
 * (engine/src/c2pa-verify.js): re-checks the credential a Lolly export embeds
 * - hashed URIs, COSE claim signature, certificate window, hard binding - and
 * prints a report whose codes mirror c2patool /
 * verify.contentauthenticity.org, headlined by the question users actually
 * ask: was this genuinely made with Lolly, by whom, and where. No jsdom, no
 * network: bytes in, verdict out.
 *
 * `--trust-anchor=<root.pem>` (repeatable) pins CA roots, the same trust
 * decision as `c2patool --trust_anchors`: a signature whose x5chain verifies
 * to a pinned root reports the CA-verified identity instead of the default
 * signingCredential.untrusted.
 *
 * TRUST ANCHORS, DECIDED (plans/73-cli-ga-contract.md §12 O1, Andy 2026-08-01):
 * the default set is the Lolly CA root + the vendored C2PA known-certificate
 * list + whatever `--trust-anchor` / `$LOLLY_TRUST_ANCHOR` pins. The Lolly root
 * used to be excluded here, so a Lolly-CA-signed export that read "Verified" on
 * the web /valid view read plain "Credential intact" in the terminal - one word
 * meaning two things depending on which surface asked. `--no-default-anchors`
 * drops BOTH built-in sets for a bare-trust check: only the caller's pinned
 * roots count, and with none pinned the anchor set is empty, under which every
 * signer reads untrusted by construction. Whichever set ran is printed with the
 * verdict, in the same words the TUI's verdict panel uses, because "verified"
 * is only meaningful beside "verified by what".
 *
 * EXIT CODES (plans/73-cli-ga-contract.md §6b) - derived from the engine's shared verdict
 * ladder (resolveVerdict), NOT from the raw report.state this file used to branch on:
 *
 *   valid / expired          → 0   the file matches what was signed
 *   likelyLolly / invalid    → 4   REFUSED: a credential is present and the bytes moved
 *   none                     → 5   NOT_FOUND: a legitimate negative answer
 *   unreadable / ENOENT      → 2   USAGE: you named a path that cannot be read
 *
 * The old mapping was 0 / 1 / 2 with a missing file ALSO 1, so a CI loop could not tell
 * a forged file from a typo'd path. An expired credential is deliberately 0: Lolly signs
 * with ephemeral 7/30/90/365-day on-device certificates, so any other rule would fail
 * every gate in the fleet on its own correct output within a month. `--strict` promotes
 * expired to 4 for anyone who wants the stricter reading, and `--require=none` turns off
 * verdict-based exit codes entirely ("just tell me what is in this file").
